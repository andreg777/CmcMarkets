# CmcMarkets

Using any MVC framework of your choice (could be vanilla) write a small javascript application which presents a simple web shopping page to a user. 
It should allow them to add and remove items to/from a virtual shopping basket. The page should also have a “check out” option that presents the user with various delivery options to select from.  
Once selected, a summary of the order + delivery method and charges should be presented.  
On acceptance, a “thank you” page should be shown.  
At any point in the process the user should be able to step back and amend their selections.
All data should be mocked (don't spend time coding database connections etc).
